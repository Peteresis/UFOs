# ðŸ‘½ UFOs
An exercise on JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

# :one: Overview of the Project

The objective of the project was to create a website that displays a table with UFOs sightings in differnet parts of the United States and Canada.  The page contains a form to input and filter data.

The website was created using HTML for the basic structure and Bootstrap to control the look of the site.  There is also a `style.css` file that works in combination with Bootstrap to complete the decoration and feel of the website.

The site shows a table with the data of the sightings.  The data comes from a file called  `data.js` that contains an array with the keys of the sightings (datetime, city, state, country, shape, durationMinutes and comments).  Here is an example of the array:

```
{
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "bonita",
    state: "ca",
    country: "us",
    shape: "light",
    durationMinutes: "13 minutes",
    comments: "Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010"
  }
```
The page also has a form in which the visitor can input different values that are then used to filter the data of the table.

After the values of the form are entered, a Javascript file called `app.js` controls the behavior of the page.
